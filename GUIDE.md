# PROCESS
- author sends letter
- it gets stored to database as well as the user
- a group of mods (bow) will receive the letter to approve or not
  - query queue
  - index based
- bot will let them know that their recipient is chill
  - people have multiple recipients 
- bot ferries messages and uses nickname to do so
  - TODO maybe you can switch between partners using a specific signal, and not "push to talk"
- bot must have a close connection option
