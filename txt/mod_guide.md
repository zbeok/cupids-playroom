**MOD GUIDE**

hello cupids! welcome to this alpha! users will send letters at `https://cupids-playroom.glitch.me/` and when they do (provided no bugs happen) you'll be able to ... gasp... hook them up! 

this is barely tested and violently buggy, but 
- `cupidbot queue` see letters in queue
- `< queue # > | < yes/no/uuid/id >` approve or disapprove of letter, and send them to user with uuid/id if specified
  ~~- todo: reaction option?~~
- `cupidbot users` list of users (abbreviated to just their ids sorry)
- `cupidbot bye < user >` unsubscribe user from cupids playroom lol
  ~~- TODO ipban user~~
- `cupidbot help` help message
  
note: as this is a small app, it may sometimes be down! check the webapp for status updates. 
as always ping snerkflerks#9048 for additional questions!
